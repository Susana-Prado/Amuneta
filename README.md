## Description

E-commerce built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and React. 

This website displays products that are for sale. Unregistered users can search and visit detail pages for each product, as well as make a purchase, add and remove products to/from their cart and specify the quantity of each item. They can then enter their address and choose Stripe to handle the payment process.

Registered users will also be able to access their profile page, with address, payment and order history information.
